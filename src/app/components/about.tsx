        About
      </h2>
      <p>
        My coding journey started when I enrolled in my first computer science
        course in college. I quickly fell in love with coding, captivated by the
        endless opportunities to learn and explore. Each area of computer
        science felt like an infinite rabbit hole, full of depth and complexity.
        By the time I graduated, I had the privilege of building web
        applications for companies committed to making a positive impact in the
        local community.
